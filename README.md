Flexbox & Grid Assignment Instructions
First, watch this video. If you have any trouble accessing or understanding it, please let me know ASAP.

However, the video doesn't accurately represent the effects of resizing on the layout because, of course, the video was taken in the browser as well. So here's a folder containing images of the layout at different widths for your reference: A2-pics-1.zip Download A2-pics-1.zip 

Your task is to create a layout like the one depicted in the video and images, using the methods described in the video. 

Requirements (see the video and images for examples and more detail):

Your main project directory should be called LastnameFirstInitialA2. It should contain index.html (properly formatted and valid, of course), a (linked, of course) stylesheet, and whatever image files you use.
You must use CSS Grid properties to create the overall layout. 
You must use Flexbox properties to create the long image with the stripes/breaks in it in the header.
You must use CSS Grid properties to lay out the three images in the main area as pictured. 
All other elements (text elements, nav menu) can be created and laid out however you like.
You may use your own colors, fonts, sizes, text, content, etc., but the number of elements and their behavior upon resizing should look like they do in the attached images and video.
All elements and areas should replicate the proportions (sizing, spacing) pictured, to a reasonable extent. Don't worry about the specific numbers, just make sure the layouts are recognizably similar.
The text in the navigation menu items should change color on hover.
Your layout must be fluid, as displayed in the video.
Your HTML and CSS must be valid and contain no errors. (Sometimes it's okay to not address a validation warning, but errors should be corrected.)
When you're finished, zip/compress the folder and attach it here by the deadline.
